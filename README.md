## Development
1. Enable eslint extentions for your respective IDE.
2. Use react hooks and not classes (new standard) [reasons](https://medium.com/better-programming/react-hooks-vs-classes-add2676a32f2#:~:text=Hooks%20allow%20you%20to%20use,that%20run%20out%20of%20order.)
3. Type case: 
   1. camel case 
   2. pascal case
4. For consistency we can use Material design.


## user
non-technical people to UI is as minimalist as it can be for clear navigation

color theme is green

webistes are scanned and not read so everything has an appropiate heading and burst of information to easily find info

follows conventions

Typography is powerful - using Roboto font

color schema

invalid route takes to home

Users Want Clarity and Simplicity
- Visually focus attention on the main button versus a bunch of buttons on the home page
- Constantly reconsider what your app or site can do to make it easier to use

 Common Design Elements Versus Creativity

 Know the Audience

less is more 
and use of simple langauge

## Getting Started

**[Optional]** If needing to provide the marker with a copy of the project that should run on their local machine for development, testing and/or marking purposes. Please include the following sections.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assingnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```
Give examples or provide a list of the required software / libraries / plug-ins

```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.


## Running the tests

If needing to run automated tests, then explain how to run the automated tests for this system. If this section is not needed, ** you may delete **.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->
